# Agenda

This is an agenda management system built using Python. It is a very primitive program.
This program is not to be used for actual agenda planning and management. Google Calendar and many other calendar
applications are much better in doing this job. This is simply just a means to demonstrate my ability to create an
application, even if it's rather primitive.

## How to use it?
